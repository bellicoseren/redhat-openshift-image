Se necesita actualizar la documentación


## Usage


**Accessing the application:**

```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Repository organization

* **`s2i/bin/`**

  This folder contains scripts that are run by [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image):

  *   **assemble**

      Is used to restore the build artifacts from the previous built (in case of
      'incremental build'), to install the sources into location from where the
      application will be run and prepare the application for deployment (eg.
      using maven to build the application etc..)

  *   **run**

      This script is responsible for running a Spring Boot fat jar using `java -jar`.
      The image exposes port 8080, so it expects application to listen on port
      8080 for incoming request.

  *   **save-artifacts**

      In order to do an *incremental build* (iow. re-use the build artifacts
      from an already built image in a new image), this script is responsible for
      archiving those. In this image, this script will archive the
      `/opt/java/.m2` directory.

## Environment variables

*  **APP_ROOT** (default: '.')

    This variable specifies a relative location to your application inside the
    application GIT repository. In case your application is located in a
    sub-folder, you can set this variable to a *./myapplication*.

*  **APP_TARGET** (default: '')

    This variable specifies a relative location to your application binary inside the
    container.

*  **MVN_ARGS** (default: '')

    This variable specifies the arguments for Maven inside the container.


```
$ docker build -t multiple/imagen-base-springboot-candidate .
